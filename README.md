This project is a smart home IoT based project. It is composed of 3 parts which are sensor node, gateway and cloud platform. Sensor node part has sensor like dht11 to sense temperature and relay which act as an actuator to automatically actuate the fan speed according to the temperature level. On the side of the gateway, wifi module is used to route the connection to the internet and hence data reach the cloud. And finally data can be analyzed, visualized from anywhere through the cloud. 
In this project ThingSpeak cloud is used.
